React Role-Based Dashboard
A simple and clean React application demonstrating role-based authentication and routing using Redux Toolkit and React Router. This project supports two user roles — Admin and User — each having different permissions and access within the app.

Features
Login system with dummy credentials for Admin and User roles.

Role-based routing:

Admins have full access to all pages and features.

Users have limited access (read and edit only).

Protected routes: Only logged-in users can access the dashboard and other internal pages.

Dynamic navbar showing links based on user role and a logout button.

Users table with role-based actions (Edit for all, Delete and Post only for Admin).

Pagination for user list (10 items per page) with Bootstrap styling.

Admin-only pages: Engineer, Customer, and Reporting pages with beautiful layouts.

Clean and responsive UI using Bootstrap and custom CSS.

Easy to extend with more roles or pages.

Technologies Used
React.js (functional components & hooks)

Redux Toolkit for state management

React Router v6 for routing

Bootstrap 5 for styling

React Icons for vector icons

CSS modules & custom CSS for UI polish

Notes
This app uses dummy authentication for demonstration only.

State is kept in Redux store and resets on page reload (no backend or persistent storage).

Easy to extend with real APIs or more advanced auth systems.
